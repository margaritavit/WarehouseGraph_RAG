# WarehouseGraph_RAG
Airline Warehouse Agent using LangChain: RAG and Cypher Query Generation

## Overview
This project utilizes LangChain to create an intelligent agent designed for interacting with an airline warehouse containing parts and tools for aircraft maintenance. The agent employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance query accuracy and efficiency, and it generates Cypher queries to interact with the airline's warehouse graph database.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhances the agent's ability to generate accurate responses by retrieving parts and tools description.
- **Cypher Query Generation:** Automatically generates Cypher queries to interact with the warehouse graph database, facilitating complex data retrieval and manipulation tasks.
- **Integration with LangChain:** Utilizes LangChain framework to streamline the development of natural language processing and understanding capabilities.
